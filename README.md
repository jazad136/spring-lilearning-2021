# spring-lilearning-2021
Java Spring: My Java Spring self-written solutions from my spring LinkedIn Learning coursework in 2021. 

### Index
See room-web-app-basic for starter content related to the room-web-app with no services.

See room-web-app for the room website for using Swing with services

See fizzbuzz-web-app for my own fun attempt at building a Fizzbuzz web app with a service that can be used to play the fizzbuzz game. 

To run the RabbitMQ application for the room-web-app-msngconsumer module of this repository, you will need to download and install Docker.
Docker must be used to run rabbit for this module to work. 
Docker is not needed for the other modules at this time. 

Scripts are provided in src/main/resources/
The script start_rabbit.sh will start RabbitMQ
The script stop_rabbit.sh will stop RabbitMQ
